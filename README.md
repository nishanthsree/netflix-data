Netflix Data Analysis
This repository contains Tableau dashboards and SQL scripts for analyzing Netflix data.

Tableau Dashboards
The "Tableau_Dashboards" directory contains Tableau dashboard files (with .twb extension) that visualize and analyze Netflix data. The dashboards provide interactive visualizations for exploring various aspects of Netflix data, such as movie genres, ratings, release years, and more. The dashboards are designed to provide insights and analysis on the provided Netflix data.

SQL Scripts
The "SQL_Scripts" directory contains SQL script files (with .sql extension) that can be used to query and analyze Netflix data using SQL. The scripts are designed to work with a specific database schema and provide SQL queries for extracting insights from the Netflix data. Please note that you may need to set up the appropriate database schema and load the data into a database management system (DBMS) before running these scripts.

Usage
To use the Tableau dashboards, you will need to have Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public installed on your local machine. Simply open the .twb files using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public and connect them to your Netflix data source. You can then interact with the visualizations to explore and analyze the data.

To use the SQL scripts, you will need to have a compatible database management system (DBMS) set up with the appropriate database schema for the Netflix data. You can then execute the SQL scripts against the database to query and analyze the data.
